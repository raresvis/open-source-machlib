The main challenge of working on this project was that there is a low amount
of documentation available about the format of a binary file. Adding to this
is the fact that the number of system calls can grow from one kernel version
to another, and the signature marking the start of the table's location
sometimes changes from one kernel version to another. Another challenge to
syscall table extraction is the fact that for some versions of the kernel, the
names of the system calls is also kept in the kernel cache, but on others they
are not.
