The binary track of the project yielded concrete progress on the anatomy of a

There is only one Fat Header (struct fat_header) and at least two Fat
Architectures (struct fat_arch). Generally, the grouping of the Fat Header and
Fat Architectures is called the 'Fat Header', even though that is not entirely

'actual' Fat Header). Such confusion is very frequently encountered.
