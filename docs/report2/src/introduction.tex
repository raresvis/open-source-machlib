Due to technological advances and the ease of access to computers the number
of programmers has increased exponentially, consequently the amount of code
that is produced on a daily basis is at an all time maximum.

Verifying every single line of code is prohibitive, so inevitably bugs/errors
will end up in the code that is released.

Due to various business reasons users only have access to the machine code that
is the result of the compilation process. Identifying human error is hard
enough even in human readable code, but it is even more difficult to do that
by examining machine code.
