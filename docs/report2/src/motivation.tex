The motivation behind this project is the fact that the main tool, which is
iExtractor, has many dependencies. This occurs because of the fact that there
is no general tool that incorporates all the functionalities the iExtractor
needs. Furthermore some of the tools are not open source, and some are
deprecated. We plan to address both these problems by unifying all the
functionalities in a single open source library.
We intend to make this project open source as we believe that it would qualify
as a good starting point for other tools to be built on by the comunity.
By providing a general and cross-platform API we will be able to cover a
greater part of the security community. A greater community means more
quality code.
