For the next week, the Binary Track will have its focus on adding the
finishing touches to the Universal Binary support feature, and only then will
the focus be shifted to first researching and then implementing the extraction
of Entitlement Signatures. 
Meanwhile, the Kernel Track will continue to add furthure support for system
call extraction, after which it will shift its focus first to extracting
kernel extensions, and after to extracting sandbox profiles from the sandbox
kernel extension.
